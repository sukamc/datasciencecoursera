# Notes

Week 3
Descriptive analysis - Describe set of data
  * First kind of data analysis performed
  * Coomonly applied to census data
  * Description and interpretation are different steps
  * Descriptions usually can't be generalized w/o additional statistical modeling
Exploratory - Find relationaships you didn't know about
  * Good for discovering new connections
  * Useful for defining future studies
  * Not usually the final say
  * Should not be used alone for generalization/predicting
  * Correlation does not imply causation
Inferential - use relatively small sample to say something about larger population
  * Inference is commonly the goal of statistical models
  * Involves estimating both the quantity you care about and your uncertainty about the estimate/quantity
  * Depends heavily on both the population and sampling scheme
Predictive - use data on some objects to predict values for another
  * If X predicts Y it does not mean that X causes Y
  * Accurate prediction depends heavily on measuring the right variables
  * Although there are better and worse prediction models, more data and a simple model works really well
  * Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future references.
Causal Analysis - find out what happens to one variable when you make another change
  * Randomized studies are usually required to identify causation
  * There are approaches to inferring causation in non-randomized studies, but they are complicated and sensitive to assumptions
  * Causal relationships are usually identified as average effects, but may not apply to every individual
  * Causal models are usually the 'gold' standard for data analysis.
Mechanistic - Understand exact changes in variables that lead to changes in other variables for individual objects
  * very hard to infer, except in simple situations
  * Usually modeled by a deterministic set of equations (physical/engineering sciences)
  * Generally the random component of the data is measurement error
  * If equations are known but the parameters are not, they may be inferred with data analysis.
  
  
Data - set of items sometimes called population
  * Question is most important.
  * Data can limit the questions.
  * Data can't save you if you don't have a question.

Experimental Design
  * Confounding - paying attention to other variables that may be effecting relationship
    * Randomization and Blocking as a way to limit confounding
        * Make a potential confounding variable fixed
        * Stratify the variable
        * Randomize the variable
  * Prediction key quantities
    * Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value, Accuracy
